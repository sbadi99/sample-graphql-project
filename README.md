# sample-graphql-project

* The Project is mostly written in Kotlin (with some Java).
* It uses the latest androidx framework (rather than older support libraries).
* 

* From a architecture standpoint, used the LiveData/ViewModel approach (per Android architectural components) to allow for UI layer to be decoupled from the business layer.
