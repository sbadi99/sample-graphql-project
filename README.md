# sample-graphql-project

* The Project is mostly written in Kotlin (with some Java).
* It uses the latest androidx framework (rather than older support libraries).
* From a UI perspective, used Android Cardviews and Recylerview and Andorid toolbar Search best practices 
* From a architecture standpoint, used the LiveData/ViewModel approach (per Android architectural components) to allow for UI layer to be decoupled from the business layer. 
* Utilizes Apollo along with Graphql
* User is able to search by Mission name or Rocket name or Launch Year

Extra's : Clicking on the search list item will launch the YouTube video if valid video link is available. Also handles progress indicator during fetching of search results e.t.c
